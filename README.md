# Nuxeo Admin console UI
Nuxeo Admin console UI is a standard base web application for Nuxeo admin users.

# Development workflow
## Required environment
- Java 17
- Maven 3+
- NodeJS 20+ + NPM
## Setup Maven and NPM repositories

Generate the `TOKEN_NAME` & `TOKEN_PASS_CODE` from [package.nuxeo.com](https://packages.nuxeo.com/#user/usertoken )
Once you have it, just add the following lines to your Maven settings.xml :

```bash
<settings>
   <servers>
      <server>
      <id>maven-internal</id>
      <username>TOKEN_NAME</username>
      <password>TOKEN_PASS_CODE</password>
      </server>
   </servers>
</settings>
```
And those lines to your NPM .npmrc :
```bash
@hylandsoftware:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
@nuxeo:registry=https://packages.nuxeo.com/repository/npm-public
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=GITHUB_TOKEN
```


## Naviagte to Working Directory
```bash
nuxeo-admin-console-web/angular-app
```

## Install dependencies
```bash
npm i
```
## Start 
```bash
npm run start
```
This makes the Admin console UI available on http://localhost:4200/.

## Run Unit Test
```bash
npm run test
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
```
# Production workflow
## Marketplace package
On root directory
```bash
mvn package
```
This will build the `nuxeo-admin-console-package/target/nuxeo-admin-console-package-${project.version}.zip` Admin Console UI marketplace to be deployed in a nuxeo server.

A nuxeo platform is expected to run on http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/nuxeoadmin. 
To configure CORS, we need to add the following line to `nuxeo.conf` file in our Nuxeo Server:
```bash
  nuxeo.cors.urls=*
```
